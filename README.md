## About the course

This slow-paced hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using Linux Containers ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Singularity](https://www.apptainer.org/)) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) to achieve reproducibility of data analysis. 

### Outline

The course will train participants to build Nextflow pipelines and run them with Linux containers.

It is designed to provide trainees with short and frequent hands-on sessions, while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum.

The course will be fully virtual via the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) platform.

<!--Trainees will work in a dedicated [AWS environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS).-->


### Learning objectives

* Locate and fetch Docker/Singularity images from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Docker/Singularity container from the command line.
* Locate and fetch Nextflow pipelines from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Nextflow pipeline.
* Describe and explain Nextflow basic concepts.
* Test and modify a Nextflow pipeline.
* Implement short blocks of code into a Nextflow pipeline.
* Develop a Nextflow pipeline from scratch.
* Run a pipeline in diverse computational environments (local, HPC, cloud).
* Share a pipeline.

### Prerequisite / technical requirements

Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.
Knowledge of containers is not mandatory. The course materials is online in the dedicated GitHub page for self-learning.

Practitioners will need to connect during the course to a remote server via the "ssh" protocotol. You can learn about it [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work)

Those who follow the course should be able to use a command-line/screen-oriented text editor (such as nano or vi/vim, which are already available on the server) or to be able to use an editor able to connect remotely. For sake of information, below the basics of "nano":

Having a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) is recommended.
