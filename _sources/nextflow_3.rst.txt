Using Singularity
=======================

We recommend to use Singularity instead of Docker in a HPC environments.
This can be done using the Nextflow parameter `-with-singularity` without changing the code.

Nextflow will take care of **pulling, converting and storing the image** for you. This will be done only once and then Nextflow will use the stored image for further executions.

Within an AWS main node both Docker and Singularity are available. While within the AWS batch system only Docker is available.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test2.nf -with-singularity -bg > log

	tail -f log

	...


Let's inspect the folder `singularity`:

.. code-block:: console

	ls singularity/
	biocorecrg-c4lwg-2018-latest.img


This singularity image can be used to execute the code outside the pipeline **exactly the same way** as inside the pipeline.

Sometimes we can be interested in launching only a specific job, because it might failed or for making a test. For that, we can go to the corresponding temporary folder; for example, one of the fastQC temporary folders:

.. code-block:: console

	cd work/da/eb7564*/


Inspecting the `.command.run` file shows us this piece of code:

.. code-block:: groovy

	...

	nxf_launch() {
	    set +u; env - PATH="$PATH" SINGULARITYENV_TMP="$TMP" SINGULARITYENV_TMPDIR="$TMPDIR" singularity exec /home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/nextflow/test2/singularity/biocorecrg-c4lwg-2018-latest.img /bin/bash -c "cd $PWD; /bin/bash -ue /home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/nextflow/test2/work/da/eb756433aa0881d25b20afb5b1366e/.command.sh"
	}
	...


This means that Nextflow is running the code by using the **singularity exec** command.

Thus we can launch this command outside the pipeline (locally):

.. code-block:: console

	bash .command.run

	Started analysis of B7_H3K4me1_s_chr19.fastq.gz
	Approx 5% complete for B7_H3K4me1_s_chr19.fastq.gz

	Approx 60% complete for B7_H3K4me1_s_chr19.fastq.gz
	...

If you have to submit a job to a HPC you need to use the corresponding program, **qsub** or **sbatch**.

.. code-block:: console

	qsub .command.run


Adding more processes
======================

We can build a pipeline incrementally adding more and more processes.
Nextflow will take care of the dependencies between the input / output and of the parallelization.

Let's add to the **test2.nf** pipeline two additional steps, indexing of the reference genome and the read alignment using `Bowtie <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml>`__. For that we will have to modify the test2.nf, params.config and nexflow.config files (the new script is available in the **test3 folder**).

In **params.config**, we have to add new parameters:


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/params.config
   :language: groovy

In **test3.nf**, we have to add a new input for the reference sequence:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/test3.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 31,32,43-48
   

This way, the **singleton channel** called **reference** is created. Its content can be used indefinitely. We also add a path specifying where to place the output files.

.. code-block:: groovy

	/*
	 * Defining the output folders.
	 */
	fastqcOutputFolder    = "${params.outdir}/output_fastqc"
	alnOutputFolder       = "${params.outdir}/output_aln"
	multiqcOutputFolder   = "${params.outdir}/output_multiQC"



And we have to add two new processes. The first one is for the indexing the reference genome (with `bowtie-build`):


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/test3.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 82-101


Since bowtie indexing requires unzipped reference fasta file, we first **gunzip** it, then build the reference index, and finally remove the unzipped file.

The output channel is organized as a **tuple**; i.e., a list of elements.

The first element of the list is the **name of the index as a value**, the second is a **list of files constituting the index**.

The former is needed for building the command line of the alignment step, the latter are the files needed for the alignment.

The second process **bowtieAln** is the alignment step:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/test3.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 103-124


There are two different input channels, the **index** and **reads**.

The index name specified by **refname** is used for building the command line; while the index files, indicated by **ref_files**, are linked to the current directory by using the **path** qualifier.

We also produced two kind of outputs, the **alignments** and **logs**.
The first one is the one we want to keep as a final result; for that, we specify the **pattern** parameter in **publishDir**.

.. code-block:: groovy

	publishDir alnOutputFolder, pattern: '*.sam'


The second output will be passed to the next process, that is, the multiQC process. To distinguish the outputs let's assign them different names.

.. code-block:: groovy

	output:
	    path "${reads}.sam", emit: samples_sam
	    path "${reads}.log", emit: samples_log


This section will allow us to connect these outputs directly with other processes when we call them in the workflow section:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/test3.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 145-152


As you can see, we passed the **samples_log** output to the multiqc process after mixing it with the output channel from the fastqc process.


Profiles
=================

For deploying a pipeline in a cluster or Cloud, in the **nextflow.config** file, we need to indicate what kind of the `executor <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#executor>`__ to use.

In the Nextflow framework architecture, the executor indicates which the **batch-queue system** to use to submit jobs to a HPC or to Cloud.

The executor is completely abstracted, so you can switch from SGE to SLURM just by changing this parameter in the configuration file.

You can group different classes of configuration or **profiles** within a single **nextflow.config** file.

Let's inspect the **nextflow.config** file in **test3** folder. We can see three different profiles:

- standard
- cluster
- cloud

The first profile indicates the resources needed for running the pipeline locally. They are quite small since we have little power and CPU on the test node.


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 8-21


As you can see, we explicitly indicated the **local** executor. By definition, the local executor is a default executor if the pipeline is run without specifying a profile.

The second profile is for running the pipeline on the **cluster**; here in particular for the cluster supporting the Sun Grid Engine queuing system:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 22-38


This profile indicates that the system uses **Sun Grid Engine** as a job scheduler and that we have different queues for small jobs and more intensive ones.

Deployment in the AWS cloud
=============================

The final profile is for running the pipeline in the **Amazon Cloud**, known as Amazon Web Services or AWS. In particular, we will use **AWS Batch** that allows the execution of containerised workloads in the Amazon cloud infrastructure (where NNNN is the number of your bucket which you can see in the mounted folder `/mnt` by typing the command **df**).

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 40-57


We indicate the **AWS specific parameters** (**region** and **cliPath**) and the executor **awsbatch**.
Then we indicate the working directory, that should be mounted as `S3 volume <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__.
This is mandatory when running Nextflow on the cloud.

We can now launch the pipeline indicating `-profile cloud`:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test3.nf -bg -with-docker -profile cloud > log


Note that there is no longer a **work** folder in the directory where test3.nf is located, because, in the AWS cloud, the output is copied locally in the folder **/mnt/nf-class-bucket-NNN/work** (you can see the mounted folder - and the correspondign number - typing **df**).

The multiqc report can be seen on the AWS webpage at https://nf-class-bucket-NNN.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/results/ouptut_multiQC/multiqc_report.html

But you need before to change permissions for that file as (where NNNN is the number of your bucket):

.. code-block:: console

	chmod 775 /mnt/nf-class-bucket-NNNN/results/ouptut_multiQCmultiqc_report.html


Sometimes you can find that the Nextflow process itself is very memory intensive and the main node can run out of memory. To avoid this, you can reduce the memory needed by setting an environmental variable:

.. code-block:: console

	export NXF_OPTS="-Xms50m -Xmx500m"


Again we can copy the output file to the bucket.

We can also tell Nextflow to directly copy the output file to the S3 bucket: to do so, change the parameter **outdir** in the params file (use the bucket corresponding to your AWS instance):

.. code-block:: groovy

	outdir = "s3://nf-class-bucket-NNNN/results"





EXERCISE
============

Modify the **test3.nf** file to make two sub-workflows:

* for fastqc of fastq files and bowtie alignment;
* for a fastqc analysis of the aligned files produced by bowtie.

For convenience you can use the multiqc config file called **config.yaml** in the multiqc process.
